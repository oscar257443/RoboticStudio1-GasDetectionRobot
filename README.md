# RoboticStudio1-GasDetectionRobot



## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Detecting gas leaks within both industrial facilities and residential areas poses great risks and consumes considerable time when performed by humans. Hence, the development of an autonomous robotic solution becomes essential. This robot would possess the ability to navigate through indoor spaces independently, identify gas leaks, and promptly notify human operators.
To take on this challenge, the main goal of this project is to create a mobile robot that is equipped with mapping and localization functionalities. This will enable the robot to effectively pinpoint gas leaks within indoor environments. The robot will have a gas sensor for leak detection and a localization system that ensures accurate mapping and navigation. Furthermore, the robot's capabilities also include algorithms designed for tasks such as evading obstacles, planning optimal paths, and detecting gas leaks.
This technology stands to enhance safety measures, mitigating the likelihood of fires or explosions while reducing any adverse environmental impact. Additionally, having a mobile robot for gas leak detection can increase efficiency and reduced expenses compared to conventional inspection methods done by humans. 

## Intro
This github repo is a place where we collect and share the code in order to get the robot working for University course Robotic Studio 1. The goal is to simulate and control a robot using SLAM and pathplanning techniques to navigate an enviroment and collect sensor data along the way within the enviroment. 


## System 
We are using ROS 1 with gazebo and Ubunutu 1.18.4 LTS on the Turtlebot 3 platform
